# This is the configuration for the `./bootstrap.py` script.
# It generates `.travis.yml`, `tox.ini` and `appveyor.yml`.
#
# Syntax: [alias:] value [!variable[glob]] [&variable[glob]]
#
# alias:
#  - is used to generate the tox environment
#  - it's optional
#  - if not present the alias will be computed from the `value`
# value:
#  - a value of "-" means empty
# !variable[glob]:
#  - exclude the combination of the current `value` with
#    any value matching the `glob` in `variable`
#  - can use as many you want
# &variable[glob]:
#  - only include the combination of the current `value`
#    when there's a value matching `glob` in `variable`
#  - can use as many you want
