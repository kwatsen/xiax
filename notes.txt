  - created /Users/Kent/.venv/python3/bin/xiax
  - running works!
      (python3) $ xiax -s sdg 

SHOULD'VE USED THE -e PARAM SO AS TO CREATE AN "EDIT" VERSION (with symlinks, etc.)
(from https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html)
# pip install -e .

Publish to PyPi
  - python setup.py register -r pypitest         # THIS FAILED: reg deprecated, use twine instead...
  - python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
  - python setup.py register -r pypi             # THIS FAILED: reg deprecated, use twine instead...
  - python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi


Or this?  works with the ~/.pypirc file?  
WHAT ABOUT THE UploadCommand in setup.py?????????
From https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/05/how-to-publish-your-package-on-pypi/
# twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
  - twine register dist/*
  - twine upload dist/*

# twine register dist/xiax-0.0.1.tar.gz -r xiax
    InvalidConfiguration: Missing 'xiax' section from the configuration file
    or not a complete URL in --repository-url.
    Maybe you have a out-dated '~/.pypirc' format?
    more info: https://docs.python.org/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc

# twine upload dist/* -r xiax


TOX   (still NOT WORKING)
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html
- https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging
    ^-- claims that `python setup.py test` is a FAILED EXPERIEMENT

BOTH OF THESE WORKED
# tox -e py37
# tox -e py37 bootstrap

THIS DOES NOT WORK (because it tries to load py27 - DON'T KNOW WHY!)
tox -e bootstrap
